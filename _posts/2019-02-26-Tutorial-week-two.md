# Tutorial week 2 - ADOBE XD PROTOTYPING

For this week I studied a lot to learn how to use Abode XD better. For that I did some tutorials at Youtube and also I did my desktop mockups for project two which helped me a lot to understand better XD and practice. The only thing that I wish I have learned before starting to do the mockups was how to create symbols because that would have helped me a lot and saved time. Now I will have to redo some of the parts of the mockups adding symbols to save time when I start to use the prototype function. 

What have I learned this past 2 weeks:
* How to use the basic tools of XD
* How to create symbols
* Started the research about prototyping
