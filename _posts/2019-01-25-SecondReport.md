# Week 2 report

This week I start to animate the icons. The first thing that I had to do was to learn how to import the logos from illustrator to after effects. Also, I learned how to work with the adobe libraries which is amazing and really helpful.

Accomplishments of the week:
* Import icons from illustrator
* How to use Adobes Libraries
* How to do fade-in and fade-out playing with the opacity
* How to do make icon appear using scale
* How to use keyframes
* Animation using shapes

I'm also sending you an after effects file with what I did till now in the d2l.
