# TUTORIAL WEEK THREE

This week I finish all the prototyping for the project two. I was able to do all the drop down menus, notification pages and link all the pages of the web site. It's really simple to use XD but to do the prototyping properly it takes a lot of time because you need to redo every single page for each interacting that you have. 

What I have learned this week: 
* How to connect the pages
* How to make the interactions
* How to make a nav bar as a symbol
* How to make dropdowns
* How to make proper buttons (But I discovered that after I finish, so I'll change for next week)
