#Week report 4

This was the final week and I discovered that I planned my time wrong. I did a lot this week to be able to finish everything that I had planned for the presentation but at the end I liked the result.

Accomplishments of the week:
* How to make a bar chart using excel, illustrator or after effects
* How to create a pie chart
* How to create a line chart
* How to make a number counter ticker 
* How to create an animated flow chart infographic
* How to export AFX video using Encore

To learn everything that I will show in the presentation I did a course at Udemy website and at end I did my own little project using the knowledge of infographics that I got in the course.
