# Tutorial week 4 - ADOBE XD PROTOTYPING

This week I had to fix some of the desktop mockups for project two and I also started to work in the tutorial project on XD.
I'm doing a web page for my youtube channel and I will use this project to make the prototyping tutorial for the end of the term. The Youtube channel is called Pra que plano B and it's about living in Canad√°. 

What I have learned this week: 
* I have watched some videos about animations on XD
* How to make some transitions
* I watched a video about plugins but I didn't try any on the project yet
