# Tutorial week 5 - ADOBE XD PROTOTYPING

For this week I just made the tutorial video and did a little webpage on XD to make my tutorial. I made a video tutorial and it was really hard to do it. It's the first time that I recorded the screen and audio from my computer and I thought that would be easier. At the end I liked the result but it was really hard to make it. 

This tutorial helped me a lot with my project for this term because everything that I learned I use it on my project. 

I uploaded in the d2l already and everything that I used for the tutorial is on my dropbox at the link below:
