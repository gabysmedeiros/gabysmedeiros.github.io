# Tutorial week 1 - ADOBE XD PROTOTYPING

For my tutorial, I decided to study the adobe XD because it's something that I can use a lot for the project of this term and for my professional life in the future. I loved the presentation that Jo√£o and Flavia did for their project and I think it will help more than editing cooporative videos that was the first idea that I had for the tutorial.

What I'm planing to learn:

* Learn the basic tools of XD
* Fixed position content
* Overlay to make a menu
* Scroll position to make a slideshow
* Auto animate
* If I have time I want to learn how to animate in xd and do voice prototyping

I'll do the tutorial about some of the fuctions that adobe XD have to do a good Prototype. I'll do small videos teaching how to do small tasks to make a prototype.
