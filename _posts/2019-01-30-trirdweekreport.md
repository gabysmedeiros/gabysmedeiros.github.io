#Week 3 report

This week I'm still working in animating logos and icons but I learned a lot of cool tricks and ways to make the animation better.

Accomplishments of the week:

* How to work with motion blur so the icons are more blury when in motion
* Over shoot - I learn how to do over shooting manually and also using some codes
* Antecipation - How to make an icon fall smoothly 
* Offser - How to make an icon get really big into the screen
* How to use illustrator files without losing the quality
* How to use the camera inside After Effects to make zooms into the screen
* Animation lines - Learn how to make an icon that will appear slowly into the screen using the lines
* Add videos to the background and learn how to use some edit tools

Next and final will I will start to work with data visualization and that is the last part that I will learn for the presentation. 

I'm posting on d2l all the after effects exercises that I did to learn all the topics posted.
